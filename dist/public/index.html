        Egregious simplifies how you can take action to reduce amount of
        excessive plastic packaging used.

      <ul>
        <li>Scan a product barcode</li>
        <li>Tweet or email the manufacturer</li>

      <h2>What is Egregious</h2>
      <p>
        We are all part of a complex and dependant relationship between
        manufacturer, supplier, and consumer. Sometimes it can feel so complex
        we cope by shutting down and consume as usual. This has taken a
        devastating toll on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Egregious we don’t pretend to have all the answers, but we do have a
        belief that small actions gather momentum and bring about larger scale
        change.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim to make it simple for you to give the manufacturers a nudge and
        let them know that excess plastic packaging bothers you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Manufacturers carry both power and wealth in this consumer-supplier
        relationship. Enough to research and find alternative packaging
        solutions and distribution systems. And we hope with enough nudging they
        will start to make changes.
      </p>
      <h2>How does it work</h2>
      <p>
        If you notice an item that bothers you, simply SCAN it and we identify
        the manufacturer. If you are linked to Twitter, you can tweet, or we
        generate a template email that is sent from you direct to direct to the
        manufacturer. You can of course customise this email.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, we have no influence in how that manufacturer deals with the
        email, they may bin it, divert it, and so on, but that isn’t the point.
        We want to gather data that shows the manufacturers that their customers
        are bothered.
      </p>
      <p>
        This first website aims to gauge if there is a desire to use such a
        service. If so we hope to develop it into a smart phone app, maybe a
        community resource. Eventually we hope there will be no need for us to
        be doing this, and the manufacturers use of excessive plastic packaging
        will come to an end.
      </p>
      <h2>Who are we</h2>
      <p>
        The people involved in this are all volunteers, offering their time,
        expertise, and money to make this happen now. If this project grows we
        may need to look into how growth and development is paid for, but our
        aim is not financially motivated.
